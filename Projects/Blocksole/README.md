# Blocksole ðŸ‘Ÿ

***Blocksole*** is a pioneering project that aims to introduce the benefits of blockchain to shop owners, with a specific focus on the sneaker resale market. The goal is to provide security, reliability, and transparency through the use of blockchain technology.

The sneaker resale market, often plagued by issues of counterfeit products and lack of trust, stands to benefit immensely from the introduction of blockchain. By providing a decentralized and cryptographically secure system, Blocksole aims to keep everyone honest, thus enhancing the overall integrity of the sneaker resale market.

This project is in its early stages and is open for collaboration. Whether you're a developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or someone with innovative ideas, your contributions can help shape Blocksole into a tool that can redefine the sneaker resale market.

## Current State

The project currently consists of a simple landing page built with React and Vite. The landing page includes a hero section, about, contact, footer, about us, specials, and more.

## Installation and Running the Project

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `pnpm install`.
4. Start the development server using `pnpm dev`.

## Future Plans

The main features we plan to implement revolve around the integration of blockchain technology into the platform. Here are some of the key features we envision:

- **Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway**: Initially, we will be implementing a payment gateway that accepts Ethereum. However, our vision is to expand this to include a multitude of other cryptocurrencies, making the platform accessible to a wider audience.

- **Smart Contracts for Transactions**: We plan to use smart contracts to handle the buying and selling of sneakers on the platform. This will ensure that all transactions are transparent, secure, and decentralized.

- **NFTs for Unique Sneakers**: One of the unique features we plan to introduce is the use of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for unique sneakers. This will allow us to trace the history of a sneaker from the moment it enters the blockchain, ensuring its authenticity.

- **Selective Reseller Participation**: To maintain the integrity of our platform, we plan to only allow resellers who can prove the history of their sneakers to create a unique NFT and sell on our platform.

- **Expansion to Other Markets**: Once we have established a secure and reliable system for the sneaker resale market, we plan to expand Blocksole to become an open market for a variety of products. Blocksole will serve as a trusted gateway between product and consumer, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

These future plans are ambitious and will require significant collaboration and contributions. We welcome ideas and contributions that can help us realize this vision.

## Tech Stack

The frontend is built with Vite, React, and Tailwind. For the backend, we plan to use Solidity for all smart contracts, which will be tested with Ganache. The first stage of backend development will focus on registering users in a decentralized yet secure way.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions in the form of ideas and code, especially for the smart contracts. Here are some of the smart contracts we need:

- User Registration: A contract to register users in a secure and decentralized way.
- Payment Gateway: A contract to handle payments in Ethereum.
- Transaction Contract: A contract to handle the buying and selling of sneakers.

## Contribution Guidelines

While we don't have specific guidelines, we expect all contributors to maintain high code quality and make meaningful commits. Please follow all relevant guidelines for the software and packages used in this project.
